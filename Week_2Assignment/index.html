    <div><h2>Verse 1</h2>
        <p>You would not believe your eyes <mark>👀</mark>
        If ten million fireflies
            Lit up the world as I fell asleep <mark>😴</mark></p>
    <p>'Cause they'd fill the open air
        And leave teardrops everywhere
        You'd think me rude
        But I would just stand and stare</p>
    <h2>Chorus</h2>
    <p>I'd like to make myself believe
        That planet Earth <mark>🌎</mark> turns slowly
        It's hard to say that I'd rather stay
        Awake when I'm asleep
        'Cause everything is never as it seems</p>
    <h2>Verse 2</h2>
    <p>'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs
        From ten thousand lightning bugs <mark>🐞</mark>
        As they tried to teach me how to dance</p>
    <p>A foxtrot above my head
        A sock hop beneath my bed
        A disco ball is just hanging by a thread</p>
    <h2>Chorus</h2>
    <p>I'd like to make myself believe
        That planet Earth <mark>🌎</mark> turns slowly
        It's hard to say that I'd rather stay
        Awake when I'm asleep
        'Cause everything is never as it seems</p>
    <h2>Verse 3</h2>
    <p>Leave my door <mark>🚪</mark> open just a crack
        <mark>(Please take me away from here)</mark>
        'Cause I feel like such an insomniac <mark>🧟‍♂️</mark>
        <mark>(Please take me away from here)</mark>
        Why do I tire of counting sheep🐑
        <mark>(Please take me away from here)</mark>
        When I'm far too tired to fall asleep <mark>😴</mark></p>
        <h2>Verse 4</h2>
        <p>To ten million fireflies<mark>🐞</mark>
            I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes<mark>👋</mark>
            I got misty eyes as they said farewell
            But I'll know where several are
            If my dreams get real bizarre
            'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar</p>
    <h2>Chorus</h2>
    <p>I'd like to make myself believe
        That planet Earth <mark>🌎</mark> turns slowly
        It's hard to say that I'd rather stay
        Awake when I'm asleep
        'Cause everything is never as it seems</p>
    <p>I'd like to make myself believe
        That planet Earth <mark>🌎</mark> turns slowly
        It's hard to say that I'd rather stay
        Awake when I'm asleep
        'Cause everything is never as it seems</p>
    <p>I'd like to make myself believe
        That planet earth <mark>🌎</mark> turns slowly
        It's hard to say that I'd rather stay
        Awake when I'm asleep
        Because my dreams are bursting at the seams <mark>🎇</mark></p></div>
